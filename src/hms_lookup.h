// (0500_0100_0002_000B, absent from the feed entirely, and 0503_0000_0003_0027,
// present with an empty description), which we rendered as two alarming rows
// reading "Other HMS error" while the printer itself reported nothing wrong.
// Undescribed codes are dropped at parse time, so they never reach the badge,
// the error screen, the alerts, or the portal card. BambuState.hmsSuppressed
// counts them and /debug reports it, so a "why is my code missing" question is
// still answerable.

// Today it is the printer's door: the dashboard has a door indicator, so an
// open door is a state, not an error. Both spellings the printers use are
// listed, including the one Bambu ships no wording for - relying on that code
// staying undescribed would leave the rule one feed refresh from breaking.
//
// A true answer here is NOT on its own a reason to drop the code. The caller
// must also know that the surface this defers to exists on that printer -
// BambuState.doorSensorPresent for the door - because "shown elsewhere" is
// false on a printer that reports the door through the advisory alone.
